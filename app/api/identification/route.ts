      'Known as the "different lizard," it was one of the most successful predatory dinosaurs of its time. ' +
      'Growing up to 32 feet long and weighing up to 2.5 tons, it was characterized by its large skull, ' +
      'sharp serrated teeth, and distinctive crests above its eyes.',
    
    'Brachiosaurus': 
      'The Brachiosaurus was a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period (154-150 million years ago). ' +
      'One of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered, it could reach heights of up to 39-52 feet and weigh up to 62 tons. ' +
      'Its most distinctive feature was its long neck, which it used to reach high tree branches. ' +
      'The name means "arm lizard," referring to its unusually long front legs.',
    
    'Stegosaurus': 
      'The Stegosaurus was a thyreophoran dinosaur from the Late Jurassic period (155-145 million years ago). ' +
      'Instantly recognizable by its row of large bony plates along its back and spiked tail, it was a herbivorous ' +
      'quadruped that grew up to 30 feet long. Despite its size, it had a brain about the size of a walnut.',
    
    'Triceratops': 
      'The Triceratops was a genus of herbivorous ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period ' +
      '(68-66 million years ago). Its most distinctive features were its large skull frill and three horns â€“ two above ' +
      'its eyes and one on its snout. These features were likely used for defense against predators and in mating displays.',
    
    'Tyrannosaurus':
